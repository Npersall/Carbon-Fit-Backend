**Carbon Fit is the 1st Place winning project of the 2017 Impacting Climate Change Internet of Things Hackathon sponsored by IBM, Particle, Northeastern University of Silicon Valley by Level Education.**

**Carbon Fit helps companies fight climate change by monitoring carbon emission outputs of their vehicles.**

_This project was built for the mock company 'Coco Club', a chocolate and coffee delivery company._

_We track and analyze Coco Club's carbon footprint by vehicle and employee._

**Challenges**

Our main challenge was time, since we built this at a one-day Hackathon. Roughly eight hours from building to pitching! Some other issues we had was getting our Particle.io device to properly send data to our back end.

**Accomplishments**

Getting hardware to work and send the correct data - Working prototype.
