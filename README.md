#Carbon Fit

###Carbon fit is a project created to combat climate change by challenging users to track and analyze their carbon footprint by means of their chosen mode of transportation.

#Inspiration:


What it does: Carbon-Fit is a 4 part tool. It is a react native mobile app, accompanied by 

#What it does:
Carbon-Fit assists companies by tracking emissions coming from their company vehicles.  Plus, we wanted to make the world a better place. 

Challenges we ran into: Our original approach to completing this app during the Hackathon was the sheer size

#How we built it:
Sketch
Ruby
Ruby on Rails
Postgres Database
Particle.io

#Challenges we ran into:
Our main challenge was time, since we built this at a one-day Hackathon. Roughly eight hours from building to pitching! Some other issues we had was getting our Particle.io device to properly send data to our back end. 

#Accomplishments that we're proud of:

Getting our hardware to work and send the correct data - luckily we had some very intelligent engineers who were able to use the Particle.io hardware work with our design concept. 

Teamwork abounded! No one had their Red Bull slapped out of their hand, and there was absolutely no eye-rolling between members. I know, it's hard to believe.  

#What we learned:
We learned that by working together, we are capable of great things. Each team member gave it their all, and even with the minimal time, we were able to reach our MVP. 

#What's next for Carbon-Fit:
Adding a rewards system for employees who reduce their carbon footprint by a certain percentage each fiscal year

#Built With:
We decided to build Carbon Fit with a Rails backend, a Postgres Database, and a React Native front end - snazzy!
